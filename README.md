# Shopping-List-API
Simple REST API made to teach myself the principles of REST API development. Includes features like email user authentification, image handling, 
and item/shopping list storage and retrieval. 

To try this API please note that you'll need both Mailgun (for email handling) and Postman to test the endpoints. 
You'll also need to create a .env file to store environment variables. See the .env.example for what this
might look like.
