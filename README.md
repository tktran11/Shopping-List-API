# Shopping-List-API
Simple REST API made to teach myself the principles of REST API development. Includes features like email user authentification, image handling, 
and item/shopping list storage and retrieval. 

To try this API please note that you'll need both Mailgun (for email handling) and Postman to test the endpoints.
